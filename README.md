# p5-projects
This repository contains a collection of small visual projects which are done using [p5js](https://p5js.org/).

Topics include:

- Automata
- Boids
- Fractals
- Noise

... and more! 

## Getting started
Running any of the projects is simple.

1. Download the source files. 
2. Have a browser installed that does not block JavaScript.
3. Open the `index.html` of the project you are interested in!
4. Enjoy!

## Future of this repo
This work is (mostly) created to accompany a seminar on the topic of emergent behavior and complexity. As time goes along, I intend to add more processing work to here. Though it will be as a hobby, and therefore don't expect fast and large changes :-)
